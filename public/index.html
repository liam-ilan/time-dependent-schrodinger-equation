      Some things don’t make sense. Here’s an example:

      When my grade 8 science teacher said that, it just didn’t sit right. It seemed as absurd as saying that a dog can be red and blue at the same time, or that it can be both rainy and sunny at the same time, or that a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time, or that...

      Anyways, I’m graduating highschool in around a week, and figured it’s about time to make sense of this conundrum, but I don’t want to just understand the math. I want to be able to visualize the phenomena. Furthermore, I want to build these visualizations myself.
